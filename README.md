# TYPO3 - Search and Index
This package provides a powerful, facetable, language- and domainaware PHP based Search implementation.
The search is performed using an intelligent SQL query to perform complex, fuzzy searches in milli-seconds.
To provide high performance the search is executed on a index of all your contents in your TYPO3 installation.
The search can handle custom record types with ease using a class based, extendable indexing algorithm. 
The indexing of pages is already implemented with its own indexer task.

Based on the index you can also generate a complete xml sitemap.
